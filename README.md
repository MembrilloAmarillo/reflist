# reflist
Simple program to organize your bibliography

It's under development, so use it at your own risk :^)

## TO-DO List

- Error handler class
- Reorganize main
- Include scan_buffer() funcition in other function, so that main() dont need to do it

## Problems

- Lexer does not work well
- Parser just don't store well the data in the stack
- And the ones I don't even know that exist
